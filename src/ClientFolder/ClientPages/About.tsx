                A library is a collection of books, and possibly other materials
                and media, that is accessible for use by its members and members
                of allied institutions. Libraries provide physical (hard copies)
                or digital (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical
                location, a virtual space, or both. A library's collection
                normally includes printed materials which may be borrowed, and
                usually also includes a reference section of publications which
                may only be utilized inside the premises. Resources such as
                commercial releases of films, television programmes, other video
                recordings, radio, music and audio recordings may be available
                in many formats. These include DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, cassettes,
                or other applicable formats such as microform. They may also
                provide access to information, music or other content held on
                bibliographic databases.
